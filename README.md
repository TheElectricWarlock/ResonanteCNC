# ResonanteCNC
A mostly 3D printed CNC machine used to create custom PCBs

This machine uses 1515 extrusions for the frame, along with 3D printed parts. The original design used a dremel style rotatory tool
for creating the pcbs but it was then switched to a laser for etching copper clad pcbs which had been previously painted with black spray paint. 
This gives far better precision and quality for the tracks and vias.
